Trees are a non-linear data structure that are good for performant lookups of data. A good example of a tree is an organizational chart.


## Terminology
- Node. The elements that make up a tree, consisting of parent-child relationships. 
- Root. This is the top most node of a tree and the only one without a parent.
- Children. The descendent of a node, termed `left child` or `right child`.
- Internal Node. A node with at least one child.
- External Node (or Leaf). A node with no children.
- Descendants. A node can have children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc.
- Subtree. A node and its descendents, essentially a tree withing the tree.
- Depth. The number of ancestors of a node, i.e. how deep into the tree the node is.
