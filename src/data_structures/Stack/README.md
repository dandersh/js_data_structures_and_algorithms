Stacks are a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure where the last item added is the first one to be removed. An example would be a stack of books. 

## Functionality
- Push (insert an item)
- Pop (remove an item)
- Peek (show the first item in the stack)
- isEmpty (returns if the stack is devoid of elements)
- Clear (empty all items in the stack)
- Size (return the number of items in the stack)
