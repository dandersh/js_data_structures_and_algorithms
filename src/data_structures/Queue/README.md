Queues are First In, First Out (FIFO) data structures where the first item added will be the first item removed. An example would be a line to order food.

## Functionality
- Enqueue (insert an item)
- Dequeue (remove an item)
- Front (returns the first item)
- isEmpty (returns if queue is empty)
- Size (returns size of queue)
